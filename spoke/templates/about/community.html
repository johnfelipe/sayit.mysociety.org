    <h1>How to get involved with SayIt</h1>
</div>
<p>SayIt is open source software. We built it for other people to use. If you'd like to get involved, here's where to start.</p>
<h2>Social media</h2>
<p>Say hello on <a href="http://twitter.com/sayitpoplus">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sayitpoplus">Facebook</a>.</p>

<h2>Mailing list</h2>
<p>Implementing your own SayIt instance? Our <a href="https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/mailman/listinfo/sayit">mailing list</a> community will help you with any problems that arise.</p>
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>Find the SayIt code in <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/sayit/">our GitHub repo</a>. SayIt is licensed under the AGPL 3.0. We hope you'll pick it up, modify it if you want to, then fork it back to benefit the wider community.</p>
<p>The data standard we use is a subset of <a href="/about/akoma-ntoso">Akoma Ntoso</a> &ndash; a standard developed specifically for use in parliaments and assemblies.</p>
<h2>Volunteering</h2>
<p>We're currently looking for volunteers to help us with SayIt. Whether you have coding skills, or transcripts you'd like to upload, <a href="mailto:sayit@mysociety.org">mail us</a> to find out more.</p>
