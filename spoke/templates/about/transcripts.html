    <h1>How to get your transcripts online</h1>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a guide for non-technical readers -
<a href="/about/akoma-ntoso">read the technical introduction</a>.</p>

<p>Are you a citizen, journalist, campaigner, researcher or public servant who
has to use transcripts regularly, and who feels the whole thing could be a lot
better and easier?</p>

<p>SayIt has been built to make transcripts attractive, easy to search, easy to
share, and easy to read on devices of all sizes. And we’re very keen to hear
from people who know about transcripts that would benefit from being published
in a nice, modern way.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>How do I get my transcripts published using SayIt?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>SayIt doesn’t yet have a simple interface that you can log into and
        start typing or transcribing &ndash; that will come later once we hear
        much more from people about what they want from transcripts online.</p>

        <p>For now, all new transcripts published in SayIt need to be converted
        into a special format before they can be published online. This
        standard has the name Akoma Ntoso (“linked hearts” in the Akan
        language, from West Africa).</p>

        <p>We don’t expect anyone except computer programmers to be able to
        make data in this format, but if you
        <a href="mailto:sayit&#64;mysociety.org">get in touch</a> with us, we
        can work with you to see if we can find someone who might be willing to
        help you.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Where will my transcripts be published, once they&rsquo;re formatted
    correctly?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>You have two options:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We host your transcripts for you, at a mysociety.org URL</li>
            <li>You host your own version of SayIt, and publish your
            transcripts as part of your own website.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Either of these options will take access to technical skills, so
        again we ask that you <a href="mailto:sayit&#64;mysociety.org">get in
        touch</a> to see if we can hook you up.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I produce new transcripts directly in SayIt?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Not just yet, but if you would like to do this, we’d love to hear
        from you. If you produce minutes for regular meetings, we’d love to
        talk to you about how we can build our transcript-making interface as
        good as possible.</p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;d like to be informed when new developments such as
        this go live, add your name here.</p>
    </dd>
