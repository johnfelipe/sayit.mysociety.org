    <h1>How to get involved with SayIt</h1>
</div>

<p>SayIt was built it for other people to use. If you'd like to get involved,
here's where to start. We&rsquo;re looking for volunteers, whether you have
coding skills or transcripts you&rsquo;d like to upload.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re technically minded, please read our <a
href="/about/developers">introduction for developers</a>, including
information on the data standard we use for transcripts and how
you can help.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not technically minded, please look
at our <a href="/about/transcripts">guide for getting transcripts online</a>,
and of course please play with our site and let us know
your thoughts.</p>
